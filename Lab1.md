## Problem Definition

- The gaming industry, despite its rapid growth, faces several challenges that hinder the seamless experience of gamers and organizations:

  - Fragmented Data Access:
    Gamers must visit different platforms to access their real-time stats and gameplay data for various games, leading to inconvenience and inefficiency.

  - Lack of Centralized Event Management:
    Gaming organizations and players struggle to organize, discover, and participate in events due to the absence of a unified event tracking and management platform.

  - Limited Real-Time Insights:
    There is no comprehensive solution that provides real-time updates on player statistics, rankings, and other gameplay metrics across multiple popular games like Call of Duty, Clash of Clans, Chess.com, FIFA, and PUBG.

  - Event Promotion and Discovery Challenges:
    Public and private gaming events often lack visibility, reducing participation and engagement. Players and organizations need a platform that can promote and discover events effectively.
